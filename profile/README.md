# The FDD no longer exists as a Gitcoin workstream
The responsibilities have been taken up by team members now in the Passport and Allo workstreams within Gitcoin
Additionally, the OpenData Community now maintains data sets and Legos for Sybil detection previously mantained by the FDD.  

# Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)
Our mission is to detect and defend the [Gitcoin ecosystem](https://gitcoin.co) from fraud attacks and threats to its legitimacy, credible neutrality and sustainability.

## Tasks
1. Read the [FDD Review](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-the-fdd-review/11095)
2. Check out our projects
3. Slay Sybils - [Join our GitcoinDAO Discord](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/GitcoinDAO-22431fe7c9794d99986a028c23ce56b5)
