# Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to detect and defend the [Gitcoin ecosystem](https://gitcoin.co) from fraud attacks!

We also work with the broader community to assist others in using data and analysis to defend and operate public goods funding.  

## Tasks
We have a [private Trello organization](https://trello.com/gtcfdd) with task boards relevant to all that we do at FDD alongside links to any resources you may need.
